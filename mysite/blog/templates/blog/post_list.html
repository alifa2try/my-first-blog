        <h2><a href="">Cryptography</a></h2>
        <p> The several encryption schemes are collectively referred to as cryptography. Encryption is the procedure for converting plaintext into ciphertext. Plaintext is the original message we convert into a coded message called ciphertext. Decryption on the other hand is the process of recovering the plaintext from the ciphertext. The several decryption schemes are referred to as cryptanalysis (Stalling, 2014).
Cryptography is of three forms symmetric cryptography (secret key cryptography), asymmetric cryptography (public key cryptography) and cryptographic hash functions. In symmetric cryptography only one key is shared by the communicating parties. This key is referred is referred to as a secret key. Each of the communicating parties possesses a copy of this key. Symmetric cryptography is also called secret key cryptography. In asymmetric cryptography also called public key cryptography each of the communicating parties possess a pair of key, a private key and a public key. Public key is use for encryption and the corresponding private key for decryption. Each of the parties has each otherâ€™s public key. To exchange message they use the public key to encrypt message and transmit it. Upon receipt of the message, the message is decrypted with the corresponding private key.

        <h2><a href="">Diffie Hellman</a></h2>
        <p> Diffie Hellman was invented by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976 (Ahmed, et al., 2012). Diffie Hellman is also called Diffie Hellman protocol, Diffie Hellman handshake, Diffie Hellman key negotiation. Diffie Hellman is usually shortened to D-H or DH. DH is a key agreement scheme. A key agreement scheme has been defined as way by which parties intending to communicate together generate a value from which they subsequently derive keys they could use in an encryption scheme. DH is a mathematical algorithm that enables two parties intending to communicate generates an identical shared secret and exchanges it over an insecure channel. The shared secret is normally used to exchange encryption key securely. DH is the first to use the concept of public keys. Uses of DH according to Palmgren (2006) can be found in Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), Internet Protocol Secured (IPSec). It is usually a common practice to use asymmetric algorithm to encrypt symmetric key for distribution and symmetric algorithm to encrypt the actual data. DH is often used in such a scenario to establish the handshake. DH is not an encryption algorithm but a method that enables the safe exchange of encryption key.The creation of a shared secret otherwise called Key Encryption Key (KEK) by DH make possible the secure exchange of the encryption key. The KEK is then use to encrypt the actual symmetric/asymmetric encryption key also called Traffic Encryption Key (TEK) or Data Encryption Key (DEK) for safe transmission (Palmgren, 2006). Diffie Hellman relies on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithm problem for its hardness (Stallings, 2011). It is called a discrete logarithm problem because calculating the inverse of exponentiation is called extracting the logarithm.</p>
